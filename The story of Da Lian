I am going to share you a true story of a young Chinese man called “Da Lian” by translating a video about him for you. I believe his experience and what he learnt may help to deal with the virus correctly and decrease the probability of which you will be infected by the virus. Along with the story, I will try to share with you a video of his, so that you can see some true things happened in the hospital. This video is the only video that I can find about the things taken place in the covid-19 hospital in Wuhan, my home province capital.
From watching the video and reading manuscript of a translation, you can see:
What's happening in Wuhan No.1 people's hospital.
How Da Lian and his colleadge fight against the virus.
How Da Lian grow from a coward to a brave man and work in the frontline against coronavirus.
Why people can be cured even they don't have the vaccine.
